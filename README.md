## 📥 Sample CSV Format

You can upload any CSV file matching the below header structure. An example (`sample_grievances.csv`) is already provided.

### ✅ Required Columns:

```csv
Timestamp,Name of the student,Register Number,Department,Mail id,Brief Statement of Grievance,Written Complaint Submitted
```
🧠 How It Works (Tech Flow)

- Admin logs in using username/password.
- Uploads the student grievance CSV file.
- Backend NLP system:
  - Processes each grievance using:
    - Classifies grievance type using Zero-Shot Classification (facebook/bart-large-mnli)
    - Extracts named entities using NER (Named Entity Recognition)
    - Assigns a priority score based on:
    - Severity of the issue
    - Keyword frequency and context
    - Whether a "Written Complaint" was submitted
    - Auto-generates a suitable response email

4. Entries are displayed in a sortable table (high → low priority).

5. Admin can:

 -  Send email acknowledgments

 -  Export the processed results as a new CSV file
