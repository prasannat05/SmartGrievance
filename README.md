# SmartGrievance - Intelligent Grievance Management System

SmartGrievance is a **Flask-based web application** powered by advanced **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** to intelligently classify, prioritize, and acknowledge student grievances submitted via CSV (from Google Forms or manual upload).

> Built with modern Bootstrap UI, intelligent backend, and a responsive, table-based dashboard interface.

## Sample CSV Format

You can upload any CSV file matching the below header structure. An example (`sample_grievances.csv`) is already provided.

### Required Columns:

```csv
Timestamp,Name of the student,Register Number,Department,Mail id,Brief Statement of Grievance,Written Complaint Submitted
```
How It Works (Tech Flow)

- Admin logs in using username/password.
- Uploads the student grievance CSV file.
- Backend NLP system:
  - Processes each grievance using:
    - Classifies grievance type using Zero-Shot Classification (facebook/bart-large-mnli)
    - Extracts named entities using NER (Named Entity Recognition)
    - Assigns a priority score based on:
    - Severity of the issue
    - Keyword frequency and context
    - Whether a "Written Complaint" was submitted
    - Auto-generates a suitable response email

4. Entries are displayed in a sortable table (high → low priority).

5. Admin can:

 -  Send email acknowledgments

 -  Export the processed results as a new CSV file

## Installation

1. Clone or Download
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartGrievance.git
cd SmartGrievance
```
3. Install Dependencies
If using requirements.txt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 Or install manually:
```
pip install flask pandas transformers scikit-learn torch
```

3. Setup Credentials

```

4. Run the Flask App
``` python app.py ```
Then open your browser and go to:
``` http://localhost:5000 ```

Exported Files
All processed results (grievance type, NER, priority, and response) will be saved to:
```
/processed/
```
